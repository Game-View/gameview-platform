---

> "Welcome to Game View Productions!
>
> A Production is where your raw video footage gets transformed into an immersive 3D experience that anyone can explore.
>
> Think of it like this: you capture the real world with your camera, and we turn it into a virtual world your fans can step inside.
>
> In the next few steps, I'll show you exactly how to create your first Production. It's simpler than you might think.
>
> Let's get started!"

>
> Try including the venue or event name, and maybe the date. For example: 'Madison Square Garden - Dec 2024' or 'Studio Session - Take 3'.
>
> You can always rename it later, so don't overthink it. Just pick something that makes sense to you."

>
> You can drag and drop videos directly into this area, or click to browse your files.
>
> [PAUSE - show drag and drop]
>
> For best results, use footage from multiple angles of the same scene. The more perspectives you capture, the more complete your 3D world will be.
>
> Don't worry about perfect synchronization — our system handles that automatically.
>
> [PAUSE - show multiple files being added]
>
> You'll see each video appear in the list with its file size. You can remove any file by clicking the X.
>
> A few tips: Keep your footage steady, avoid sudden movements, and make sure you have good lighting. These help create sharper, more detailed 3D scenes.
>
> When you're ready, we'll choose your quality settings."

>

> 'Fast Preview' is great for quick tests. It processes in about 15 minutes, perfect for checking if your footage works well together.
>
> 'Balanced' is our recommended setting. It gives you great quality with reasonable processing time — usually around 30 to 45 minutes.
>
> 'High Quality' is for your final productions when every detail matters. This takes longer, typically an hour or more, but produces the sharpest results.
>
> For your first time, I'd suggest starting with 'Balanced'. You can always re-process with higher quality later."

>
> Feel free to close this tab — we'll send you a notification when it's ready.
